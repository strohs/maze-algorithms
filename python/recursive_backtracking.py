# Recursive Backtracking
# Hereâ€™s the mile-high view of **recursive backtracking**:
#
# 1. Choose a starting point in the field.
# 2. Randomly choose a wall at that point and carve a passage through to the adjacent cell, but
#    only if the adjacent cell has not been visited yet. This becomes the new current cell.
# 3. If all adjacent cells have been visited, back up to the last cell that has uncarved walls and repeat.
# 4. The algorithm ends when the process has backed all the way up to the starting point.
#    cx,cy is the current cell being visited

# Primâ€™s approaches maze generation from a different angle. Rather than working edgewise across the
# entire graph, it starts at one point, and grows outward from that point.
# The standard version of the algorithm works something like this:
#   1. Choose an arbitrary cell from G (the grid), and add it to some (initially empty) set V.
#   2. select a cell (current) from V with the lowest weight
#   3. get all unlinked neighbors of current and select the neighbor with the lowest weight (neighbor)
#   4. if a neighbor was found:
#   5.   link current to it
#   6.   add neighbor to V
#   7. else (backed into a corner of the maze)
#   8.   remove current from V
#   9. repeat steps 2 thru 9 until there are no longer cells in V

/// Generates a random maze using Prims algorithm.
///
/// Primâ€™s approaches maze generation from a different angle. Rather than working edgewise across the
/// entire maze, it starts at one point, and grows outward from that point.
/// The standard version of the algorithm works something like this:
///   1. Choose an arbitrary cell from G (the maze), and add it to some (initially empty) set V (toVisit).
///   2. select a cell (currCell) from V with the lowest weight
///   3. get all unlinked neighbors of currCell and select the neighbor with the lowest weight (neighbor)
///   4. if a neighbor was found:
///   5.   link currentCell to it
///   6.   add neighbor to V
///   7. else (backed into a corner of the maze)
///   8.   remove current from V
///   9. repeat steps 2 thru 9 until there are no longer cells in V
///
/// # Params
/// `height` - the number of rows to generate
/// `width` - the number of columns to generate
/// # Returns
/// a `GridMaze` containing the randomly generated maze
///

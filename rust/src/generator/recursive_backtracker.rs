/// Returns a maze generated using the recursive-backtracker algorithm
///
/// Hereâ€™s the mile-high view of **recursive backtracker**:
///
/// 1. Choose a random starting point in the grid.
/// 2. Randomly choose a random neighbor that has not been visited and link to it. This neighbor
///    becomes the new current cell.
/// 3. If all neighbor cells have been visited, back up to the last cell that has unvisited
///    neighbors and repeat.
/// 4. The algorithm ends when the process has backed all the way up to the starting point.
///
/// in essence, this carves passages using a depth-first search with back-tracking.
/// Also, like hunt-and-kill, recursive-backtracker also produces mazed that are full of long
/// and meandering passages.

/// 1. Choose a starting point in the field.

///    only if the adjacent cell has not been visited yet. This becomes the new current cell.
/// 3. If all adjacent cells have been visited, back up to the last cell that has uncarved walls and repeat.
/// 4. The algorithm ends when the process has backed all the way up to the starting point.

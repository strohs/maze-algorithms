/**
 * Primâ€™s approaches maze generation from a different angle. Rather than working edgewise across the
 * entire graph, it starts at one point, and grows outward from that point.
 * The standard version of the algorithm works something like this:
 *   1. Choose an arbitrary cell from G (the grid), and add it to some (initially empty) set V.
 *   2. select a cell (current) from V with the lowest weight
 *   3. get all unlinked neighbors of current and select the neighbor with the lowest weight (neighbor)
 *   4. if a neighbor was found:
 *   5.   link current to it
 *   6.   add neighbor to V
 *   7. else (backed into a corner of the maze)
 *   8.   remove current from V
 *   9. repeat steps 2 thru 9 until there are no longer cells in V

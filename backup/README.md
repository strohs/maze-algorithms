This `backup` directory contains older maze generation code that uses a single integer type to represent the walls in
each cell of a maze. The "newer" code base uses a specialized "Cell" class to represent each cell of a maze. This
class is much nicer to work with and learn from, but more memory intensive.

The backup code is functional, and should be "almost completely" documented. If your curious to see another approach
to representing mazes go ahead and take a look.

/**
 * generates a random maze using recursive backtracker algorithm.
 *
 * Hereâ€™s the mile-high view of recursive backtracker:
 * 1. Choose a random starting point in the grid.
 * 2. Randomly choose a random neighbor that has not been visited and link to it. This neighbor
 *    becomes the new current cell.
 * 3. If all neighbor cells have been visited, back up to the last cell that has unvisited
 *    neighbors and repeat.
 * 4. The algorithm ends when the process has backed all the way up to the starting point.
 *
 * In essence, this carves passages using a depth-first search, that backtracks once it carves itself
 * into a corner. Also, like hunt-and-kill, recursive-backtracker also produces mazes that are full
 * of long and meandering passages.
 *
 * @param height the number of rows in the maze
 * @param width the number of columns in the maze
 * @returns Grid containing the cells of the maze
